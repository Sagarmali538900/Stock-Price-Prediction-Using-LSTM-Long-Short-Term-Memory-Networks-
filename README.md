# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM-Long-Short-Term-Memory-Networks-
This notebook demonstrates how to build a deep learning time-series forecasting model using LSTM networks to predict future stock prices. LSTM models are widely used in financial forecasting because they can capture long-term patterns, trends, and dependencies in sequential data.
